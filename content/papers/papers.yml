    Smart Internet of Things (IoT) devices are on the rise in popularity, with
    innovative use cases and applications emerging every year. Including
    intelligence in these novel systems presents the challenge of integrating
    interaction and communication in scenarios where traditional interfaces are
    not viable. Hand Gesture Recognition (HGR) has been proposed as an
    intuitive Human-Machine Interface, potentially suitable for controlling
    several classes of devices in the context of the Internet of Things. This
    paper proposes a low-power in-ear HGR system based on mm-wave radars,
    efficient spatial and temporal Convolutional Neural Networks and an
    energy-optimized hardware design. 

    The design is suitable for battery-operated devices, with stringent 
    size and energy constraints, enabling user interaction with wearable devices,
    but also suitable for home appliances and industrial applications. The
    proposed machine learning model is characterized thoroughly for robustness
    and generalization capabilities, achieving 94.9% (single subject) and 86.1%
    (Leave-One-Out Cross-validation) accuracy on a set of 11+1 gestures with a
    model size of only 36KiB and inference latency of 32.4ms on a 64MHz
    Cortex-M33 microcontroller, making it compatible with real-time
    applications. The system is demonstrated in a fully integrated,
    miniaturized in-ear device with a full-system average power consumption of
    18.4mW, a more than 6x improvement on the current state of the art.

  abstract: |
    The recent ubiquitous adoption of remote conferencing has been accompanied 
    by omnipresent frustration with distorted or otherwise unclear voice 
    communication. Audio enhancement can compensate for low-quality input 
    signals from, for example, small true wireless earbuds, by applying noise 
    suppression techniques. Such processing relies on voice activity detection 
    (VAD) with low latency and the added capability of discriminating the 
    wearer’s voice from others - a task of significant computational complexity. 
    The tight energy budget of devices as small as modern earphones, however, 
    requires any system attempting to tackle this problem to do so with minimal 
    power and processing overhead, while not relying on speaker-specific voice 
    samples and training due to usability concerns.

    This paper presents the design and implementation of a custom research 
    platform for low-power wireless earbuds based on novel, commercial,
    MEMS bone-conduction microphones. Such microphones can record the wearer’s 
    speech with much greater isolation, enabling personalized voice activity 
    detection and further audio enhancement applications. Furthermore, the 
    paper accurately evaluates a proposed low-power personalized speech 
    detection algorithm based on bone conduction data and a recurrent 
    neural network running on the implemented research platform. This algorithm
    is compared to an approach based on traditional microphone input. The 
    performance of the bone conduction system, achieving detection of speech 
    within 12.8ms at an accuracy of 95% is evaluated. Different SoC choices are
    contrasted, with the final implementation based on the cutting-edge Ambiq 
    Apollo 4 Blue SoC achieving 2.64mW average power consumption at 14uJ per 
    inference, reaching 43h of battery life on a miniature 32mAh li-ion cell and 
    without duty cycling.

    Monitoring of physiological parameters support early detection, prevention,
    and management of adverse healthcare related events. In-ear wearable sensor
    nodes that track changing bio-physiological signals can be advantageous
    over traditional monitoring methods in being compact, unobtrusive, and
    inconspicuous, increasing their appeal. However, in-ear ergonomics place
    rigid constraints on a device’s physical design and size, limiting battery
    lifetime and restricting the incorporation of multiple sensor modules. This
    work presents the design and implementation of the wireless hearable
    VitalPod, an in-ear multivital sign monitor that measures heart rate (HR),
    respiratory rate (RR), blood oxygenation (SpO2), skin temperature and
    activity. 
    <br> 
    <br> 
    The VitalPod is designed with low power and energy efficiency in
    mind, using novel sensing integrated circuits and processing modules that
    achieve operational longevity of up to 42 hours using a small form factor
    32mAh rechargeable Li-ion polymer battery. It has a compact design and form
    factor, similar to many commercial wireless earbuds, featuring hardware
    required for wireless music playback using a standard balanced armature
    driver in addition to vital sign monitoring sensors. Experimental results
    show high performance in estimating vital signs for HR (-0.061± 1.12 beats
    per minute ), RR (0.87±1.48 breaths per minute) and change in SpO2
    (0.21±0.82%). Additionally, the presented work also evaluates the
    positional placement of sensors in the ear to reduce the effect of motion
    induced artifacts.
