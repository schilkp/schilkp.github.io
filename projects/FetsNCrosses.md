## Overview + Features

An implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe / Knots and Crosses game built entirely from 2458 discrete transistors.

While playing around with a graphical [logic simulator](http://www.cburch.com/logisim/) during a 'Digital Design' lecture, I came up 
with a simple Tic-Tac-Toe game, featuring both a player-vs-player or player-vs-computer mode. It is capable of detecting 
all possible win/draw states, and features a move validator, allowing it to reject invalid inputs from the user.

The 'Engine' against which a player can play was originally implemented using a parallel input/output ROM as a large lookup table:
The current board state was applied to the 18-bit applied to the ROM address input, and the engine's move read from memory.
This worked well, but was very inefficient: less than 5% of all possible inputs corresponded to possible game states.

In a second step I replaced this implementation with a purely combinational logic-gate based module, also capable of 
perfect play.

## Hardware Implementation

The final circuit was much simpler than I first expected it to be: It only requires 19 Flip-Flops (18 for the 
current game state, and one to track the active player), and a handful of basic gates. Some quick 
estimates put that around 2000 transistors when implemented in CMOS - how hard could that be to implementen?
